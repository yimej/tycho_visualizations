			<h3><b>Project Overview</b></h3>
			<p>Welcome to a visualization website for the case reports of West Nile Virus in the United States, from 2010 - 2017.  As you will see, there is an interactive map of the United States, which shows the number of cases in each state, incremented by year.  There is also a bar chart that shows the number of total cases per state in the ten year reporting period, along with a pie chart which shows how much each state contributes to the overall case number for the country. The data was downloaded from Project Tycho, a NIH funded initiative managed by the Univeristy of Pittsburg to house large amounts of infectious disease data for research purposes.</p>
			<p>If you are unfamiliar with West Nile Virus, please read below for some basic information regarding the disease and its impact on society.</p>

			<h3><b>West Nile Virus Information</b></h3>
			<h4><b>Symptoms</b></h4>
			<p><b>No symptoms in most people.</b> Most people (8 out of 10) infected with West Nile virus do not develop any symptoms.</p>
			<p><b>Febrile illness (fever) in some people.</b> About 1 in 5 people who are infected develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this type of West Nile virus disease recover completely, but fatigue and weakness can last for weeks or months.</p>
			<p><b>Serious symptoms in a few people.</b> About 1 in 150 people who are infected develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord).</p>
			<li>Symptoms of severe illness include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis.</li>
			<li>Severe illness can occur in people of any age; however, people over 60 years of age are at greater risk. People with certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, and people who have received organ transplants, are also at greater risk.</li>
			<li>Recovery from severe illness might take several weeks or months. Some effects to the central nervous system might be permanent.</li>
			<li>About 1 out of 10  people who develop severe illness affecting the central nervous system die.</li>
			<h4><b>Diagnosis</b></h4>
			<p>See your healthcare provider if you develop the symptoms described above. Your healthcare provider can order tests to look for West Nile virus infection.</p>
			<h4><b>Treatment</b></h4>
			<p>No vaccine or specific antiviral treatments for West Nile virus infection are available. Over-the-counter pain relievers can be used to reduce fever and relieve some symptoms. In severe cases, patients often need to be hospitalized to receive supportive treatment, such as intravenous fluids, pain medication, and nursing care. If you think you or a family member might have West Nile virus disease, talk with your health care provider.</p>
